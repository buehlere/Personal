The purpose of these notebooks is to demonstrate how to acquire data from the Spotify RESTful API, and use it for analysis. The first notebook covers how to walk through the authorization process with the Spotify API for multiple users (see https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). For this notebook to be successfully recreated, authorization codes must be gathered from different spotify users, but beside this step the notebook should be relatively straight forward to follow. The second notebook is a program, which builds a data frame containing audio information about authorized users' playlists. This program can be easily tweaked to gather different types of information avaliable via the Spotify API. The last notebook is a presentation and analysis of the gathered data. The graphs in this file were created via Tableau. However, the data outputed in Notebook 2 can be easily used for analysis in other software packages.
