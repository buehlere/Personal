# Personal

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate some of the kinds of visuals that can be made via the spotify API. The graphs in this file were created via Tableau. However, the data outputed from the API can easily be used for analysis in other software packages. This projected was created by me and my partner Miranda Perez.
